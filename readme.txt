Javascript has beaten me, I have fallen but I will get back up. 
I failed to complete all my requirments this week. Loops had be fuzzy and I was spending a lot of time re-educating myself. I found my self trying to use C++ instead of javascript a few times and I must have started over a dozen times. 
I wanted to make a while loop change the heart icon on a bad choice leading to death but....it did not come through.
I did manage to create a name holder on the top bit and make my buttons disappear in batches based on a different button press but I could not figure how to make them appear on the same succesfully thusly the buttons remain visable until conditions are met..
